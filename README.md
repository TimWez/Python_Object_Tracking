# Python_Object_Tracking
This repository contains the code used to track green objects sliding over a floor. The code produces the an (x,t) and (v,t) Graph, and calculations the friction coeff.

main.py creates the (x,t) and (v,t) diagrams

normal.py plots the normal distribution graphs.

airresistance_work_modulation.py modulates and plots the work done by the airresitance.
